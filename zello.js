so here imma disguest every advanced concept
abstract tfakar the philosophie concept of triangle ta3 not same drawing but can be reconized
base is used to use element from overrided methods
3andak linq in the system is used to add more methods to objects for example imagine you have a class that have an 
double attribute to do it sum just type .sum(e => e.thatattri;)
can use the where key word too to specifie where you want the change
key word where used to specifie things ex you want to specifie a generic beli howa class T:class
we the async await in here +matansach to use generics
generics really importants un c# 5atach t5alih yghati 3la weaknesses ta3ah bah ywalo fel level ta3 py and js

delegates
delegates 3tiha a scope bah ta5dam fih
basic idea howa to pass a method by reference nrmlment used as anonymous function
u generaler dont have to dirha out side arrow func chaya just for help tfakar beli they have same return params types
delegate type name(params);

bitch i have pointer pointer chi cheeky one after learning they all do have it so i was wrong thx

so delegates can be conbined by using the + operator and you can pass delegates as arguments

/*asp  stand proud you r strong but django still better
best part is it is just like node or django the mvc
microsoft da3matah bah ywali yasna3lak auto staff like superuser staff in django

controller is the controller folder it return views base on functions names
you can create as much controller as you want it is the same as node or django apps but they r simpler

Models is the Models folder
there is wa7da wajda but you should add yours 
same as django create a class as a database chaya it need constructor

now where the asp is strong is that it auto generates code it is the same as .net 
it make a faster building but still django better with restAPI

migration they are accesed from from data folder same as django chaya it sucks bcz you have to runapp to do it
do the changes in package manager console tfakar each database 
sna3alha table generate auto crud and then 
dir 
enable-migrations
add-migration name
ki dirha di tal9a database history as django 

use update-database command
this will create tables for your database

to see your database 7awas 3la sql server object explorer
it is a bunch of shit chaya chaba it display your database in a nice way
and can be modified
the best part about asp is that those right click you do really create both back and front
it is as django chaya better chwiya but still django api better


now why node is better node can do the same faster but fel heavy staff lo5rin 5ir(faster) 
node is easier to spot problems bcz you created everything meanwhile asp you do right click django chwiya dangerous
node can be used by any pattern mvc with orm object rational(ta3 each table have a class) mapping or old fashion way dio
